# library-automation
This project aims to develop a library automation management system.System; It allows adding books and viewing the book list, keeping track of members, and managing book borrowing transactions effectively and regularly.The main components of the project and the data structures used are summarized below:

-A tree data structure has been used for adding and managing books. The tree structure enables fast addition and display of books. Particularly in large datasets, it efficiently performs search and sorting operations, ensuring users easy access to books.

-In managing member information, a stack data structure has been preferred. The stack structure allows members to be managed according to the last in, first out principle. This is particularly useful in scenarios where quick access to the information of the most recently added member is required, especially in membership processes.

-A queue data structure has been used to track borrowed books. The queue structure operates on the first in, first out principle, organizing the sequence of book borrowing transactions.

-A linked list data structure has been used to track overdue books. The linked list allows overdue books to be dynamically added and removed, facilitating easy management. This structure enables quick identification of overdue books and the execution of necessary actions.
